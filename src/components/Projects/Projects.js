							title="Computational Offloading using Deep Learning"
							description="Computational offloading, is a technique used to improve the performance and efficiency of resource-constrained devices, such as smartphones, tablets, or IoT devices, by offloading computational tasks to more powerful remote servers or cloud services. This process allows the device to perform complex calculations and tasks without being limited by its own hardware capabilities"

							title="Energy Efficient Smart Irrigation System"
							description="An IoT based smart irrigation system which uses parameters such as soil moisture, humidity and environment temperature and also take crop type as user input then accordingly water the plants as predicted by the AI model. The system uses the decision tree model which takes in all parameters as input and provides a decision on watering the field. The system also uses the solar panel to charge the battery of the system and make it energy efficient.This was a collaborative project and the decision tree model was trained using a self generated dataset and it was able to achieve an accuracy of 98%."
